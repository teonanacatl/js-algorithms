# JS-Algorithms

This repository contains JavaScript implementations of various algorithms and data structures. Each algorithm and data structure has its own separate README with related explanations.

## Algorithms

Here is a list of all the algorithms in this repository:

1. **bst**: A simple implementation of a binary search tree (BST) in JavaScript.
2. **count-vowels**: A function that counts the number of vowels in a given string.
3. **create-queue**: A simple implementation of a Queue data structure.
4. **sorting-examples**: Implementations of Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Merge Sort algorithms.
5. **nth-fibonacci**: A function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number.

## Data Structures

Here is a list of all the data structures in this repository:

1. **create-queue**: A simple implementation of a Queue data structure.
2. **bst**: A simple implementation of a binary search tree (BST) in JavaScript.

## Tests

Each algorithm and data structure comes with its own test cases to verify its correctness.

## Usage

To use these algorithms and data structures in your project, import the functions or classes from their respective files.
